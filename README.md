# Data Analysis Project - Day 1

## Introduction

Welcome to the beginning of my data analysis journey! Today, I am diving into my first project by selecting a dataset from Kaggle. This blog post will document my thought process, actions, and key learnings as I embark on this exciting exploration.

## Step 1: Defining the Objective

Before jumping into dataset selection, it's essential to outline a clear objective. Here's what I aim to achieve:

- Practice and enhance my exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills.
- Identify patterns and insights that could answer a real-world question.
- Share my discoveries and methodologies with a global audience.

I want to choose a dataset that is:

- Beginner-friendly yet insightful.
- Relevant to current global or societal interests.
- Rich enough to allow multiple analyses but manageable for a first project.

## Step 2: Exploring Kaggle Datasets

Kaggle offers a vast repository of datasets, making it a treasure trove for data analysts. Here are the steps I followed:

1. **Browse by Popularity**:
    - I explored the "Trending Datasets" section to identify what’s currently catching the interest of the data community.
2. **Filter by Tags**:
    - I used tags like "Beginner," "CSV," and "Clean Data" to ensure the dataset is suitable for my level.
3. **Shortlist Options**:
    - I shortlisted the following datasets:
        1. **"Netflix Movies and TV Shows"**: Analyze trends in streaming content.
        2. **"Global COVID-19 Vaccination Progress"**: Understand the global vaccination rollout.
        3. **"Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection"**: Explore financial fraud detection techniques using simulated transaction data.

## Step 3: Dataset Selection

After careful consideration, I decided to go with **"Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection."** Here’s why:

- **Practical Application**: Fraud detection is a critical area in financial analysis, and this dataset provides a safe yet realistic environment to explore it.
- **Learning Opportunity**: The dataset includes simulated transaction data, offering a chance to practice classification and anomaly detection techniques.
- **Visualization Potential**: The data can be visualized to uncover fraud patterns and trends.
